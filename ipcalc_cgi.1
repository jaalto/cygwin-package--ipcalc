.SH SYNTAX 
\fBipcalc\fR should be called as a CGI application from

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBipcalc_cgi\fR is the web based version
of \fBipcalc\fR. It takes an IP address and netmask and calculates 
the resulting broadcast,
network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range. By giving a second netmask, you
can design sub- and supernetworks. It is also intended to be a teaching tool
and presents the results as easy-to-understand binary values.
